Just a little co-op clicker game made entirely in Reason.

You should be able to install if you have [reason](http://github.com/facebook/reason) installed, simply run `npm i`. To start the server run `PORT=3000 node _build/top/app.js` and go to `localhost:3000`.

Tap around to move, tap on monsters to kill them.

## Why is this cool?
The client and server share code which gets compiled to the same JS file which is used for both the client and the server.
